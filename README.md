This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects during the study program in the technical informatics major. These projects involve data analysis, algorithm implementation and visualization based on real-case problems using Python and RapidMiner. This project is organized as a learning process to improve my skills and expertise in this field, so the datasets are from openly available sources.
