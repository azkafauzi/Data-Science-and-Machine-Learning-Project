This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects during the study program in the technical informatics major. These projects involve data analysis, algorithm implementation and visualization based on real-case problems using Python and RapidMiner. This project is organized as a learning process to improve my skills and expertise in this field, so the datasets are from openly available sources.

## Projects

[Correlational Analysis of Movie Data (1980-2020)](https://github.com/azkafauzi/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Project/tree/768f455b71bfe6dab668fbb371ef49dcb4e3d759/Correlational%20Analysis%20of%20Movie%20Data%20(1980-2020))

- **Description:** This project analyzes the strength of the relationship of each attribute on a dataset of movies from 1980 - 2020.
- **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).
- **Result:** Budget and gross have a strong correlation of 0.74 and gross and votes have a moderately strong correlation of 0.61. Meanwhile, the data does not show any correlation between company and gross because company is a string not a numeric value so correlation cannot be done. This is also true for other string attributes.

[Klasifikasi Diagnosis Tumor Ganas dan Tumor Jinak (Kanker Payudara)](https://github.com/azkafauzi/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Project/tree/768f455b71bfe6dab668fbb371ef49dcb4e3d759/Klasifikasi%20Diagnosis%20Tumor%20Ganas%20dan%20Tumor%20Jinak%20(Kanker%20Payudara))

- **Description:** This project predicts the diagnosis of breast cancer, M (Mallignant) and B (Benign).
- **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification algorithm.
- **Result:** The SVM model has the best performance with 96% accuracy.

[Sonar, Mines vs Rocks](https://github.com/azkafauzi/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Project/tree/768f455b71bfe6dab668fbb371ef49dcb4e3d759/Sonar%2C%20Mines%20vs.%20Rocks)

- **Description:** This project aims to detect whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine, based on sonar signals.
- **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses SVM, Naive Bayes - Gaussian and Random Forest Classifier.
- **Result:** The best classification model was obtained by Random Forest with an accuracy of 97%
